Leetcode gives me an easy way to program everyday, to give me a break from the projects and work. I put my solutions here for tracking
purposes. I'm doing the questions in numerical order, so the code will be higher quality the larger the number is. I'm only doing this
in Python and C++.

This project is documented on my website:\
